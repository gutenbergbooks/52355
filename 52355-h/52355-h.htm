<p>Below is given report to the Governor of Tennessee by the author of
this volume as chairman of the authorized Tennessee Committee of Research.
Attached are letters of concurrence from two of his associate members.
The remaining member is out of the country. Documents have
been sent to him, but at the time of this printing sufficient time has not
elapsed to hear from him. In a later edition his comments will be given.</p>
<hr />
<p class="center"><span class="small">NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE</span>
<br />To His Excellency, The Honorable Hill McAllister,
<br />Governor of Tennessee.</p>
<p>Sir:</p>
<p>The General Assembly of Tennessee of 1927 adopted the following joint resolution:</p>
<p>WHEREAS, the Battle of New Orleans, fought on January 8, 1815, is one of the
outstanding military events of American History; and,</p>
<p>WHEREAS, the memory of the great American victory achieved there, is especially
cherished by Tennesseans because of Andrew Jackson, and the other Tennesseans
who therein immortalized themselves; and,</p>
<p>WHEREAS, school histories, adopted for and taught in our schools, convey the
impression that the battle was a needless one in that it occurred fifteen days after the
Treaty of Peace had been signed at Ghent, Belgium, by the Commissioners representing
the United States and England; and,</p>
<p>WHEREAS, serious criticism is made that such textbooks present an erroneous
appraisement of the value of the battle, by omitting the reference to an essential fact,
to-wit: that England did not construe the Peace Treaty of Ghent as applicable to
Louisiana, for the reason that she held as invalid the title of the United States to that
Domain, conveyed by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1803; and,</p>
<p>WHEREAS, it is of prime importance that our school children should receive
every essential truth from historical textbooks, and especially those textbooks placed
in the hands of Tennessee students should portray in its true significance the Battle of
New Orleans in which the ancestors of so many were engaged; now,</p>
<p>THEREFORE, be it resolved by the Senate, the House of Representatives concurring,
that the Governor be, and is hereby empowered and authorized, to appoint
five, or in discretion seven, persons of known historical knowledge and research, who
shall constitute a Commission, charged with the duty of carefully examining the
authorities, touching the true value of the Battle of New Orleans, fought January 8,
1815; and,</p>
<p>Said Commission shall incorporate its conclusions and recommendations in a
report to the Governor who shall transmit the same to the Legislature.</p>
<p>Under the above resolution the following were appointed: Reau E. Folk, Chairman;
John Trotwood Moore; John H. DeWitt; Claude G. Bowers; John S. Kendall.</p>
<p>The chairman, by reason of partial business retirement, has been able to devote
himself assiduously to the research work involved. The result of his research, compiled
into a small volume, accompanies this report.</p>
<p>At the outset the writer wishes to say he has had no opportunity for conference
with the full Commission, but has had the benefit of consultation with Messrs. Moore
and DeWitt, both of whom were very co-operative. The first named, the late John
Trotwood Moore, State Historian, condensed his conclusion into a sentence, which is
here given because he is no longer with us to speak for himself. He said: &ldquo;The Battle
of New Orleans saved the Louisiana Purchase, or another war with England.&rdquo; Judge
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
John H. DeWitt, President of the Tennessee Historical Society, has given much
valuable and sympathetic aid.</p>
<p>The small volume herewith submitted gives exact quotations concerning the Battle
of New Orleans from all histories under adoption as textbooks for the public schools
of Tennessee. All of these present the same viewpoint, to-wit: that the battle was an
unnecessary one; that it was fought after peace had been made. These researches
show conclusively that all these books are in error. The battle was NOT fought
after peace.</p>
<p>These researches have uncovered a startling, astounding fact&mdash;startling and
astounding because that fact has been consistently ignored or overlooked by historians.
That fact appears in the wording of the Ghent Treaty itself, which says in plain
language that peace shall be effective when the treaty shall have been ratified by both
sides! It was ratified by the United States February 17, 1815, forty days after the
Battle of New Orleans!</p>
<p>Hence it must be patent to all that the statement, that the battle occurred after
peace made so persistently by historians, is an obvious untruth, based on false assumption
of fact. The wording of the treaty, appearing in the volume herewith, has been
verified from the treaty itself on file in the State Department at Washington.</p>
<p>If the issue of the battle had been different, it is a matter for fair speculation as
to whether or not the treaty would have been ratified by the United States. The
Administration would have been torn between the ominous threats of the northeastern
states on the one hand, and on the other by British occupancy of the vast territory
west of the Mississippi River, with civil government set up. Happily this grave
situation was averted by the great victory, news of which reached Washington ten days
before the treaty.</p>
<p>In the volume herewith there is presented well authenticated evidence leading to
the irresistable deduction that it was England&rsquo;s purpose after capturing to retain the
great Louisiana Domain, on the ground of the invalidity of the U. S. title acquired
from Napoleon in 1803. Among other indications of England&rsquo;s attitude there are
exhibited copies of records during the negotiations at Ghent taken from the archives
of the State Department at Washington.</p>
<p>The chairman, as the compiler of the volume referred to, hopes it will be carefully
read by all interested in truth of history, not only in Tennessee, but in the nation.</p>
<p>The writer, in obedience to the Legislative resolution under which he was appointed,
herewith asks leave to report as his findings as to the true value of the Battle of New
Orleans the following:</p>
<p>1st: It did not occur after peace as erroneously is stated by school and other
histories; it occurred during a state of war between the United States and England;</p>
<p>2nd: It was a necessary battle, made so by the aggressions of England; in
addition to its national necessity, it was as necessary as would be the defense by a
citizen of his home and family from marauders;</p>
<p>3rd: It was a major military event in the life of the Republic, second only to
Yorktown;</p>
<p>4th: It saved the Louisiana Purchase, or prolongation of existing war, or another
war with England; or acquiescense in the Mississippi River as our western boundary;</p>
<p>5th: It established wholesome respect of U. S. sovereignty by Great Britain,
marking the last armed conflict between these two powers, between which a solid
peace has existed ever since;</p>
<p>6th: It created profound impression throughout the world, with consequent greater
respect and security of the Republic among her sister nations;</p>
<p>7th: It restored national self respect, then at its lowest ebb.</p>
<p>In submitting the result of this research the writer earnestly recommends to the
Governor and the General Assembly that proper and decisive steps be taken to the end
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
that our school children may be taught the truth as to the value of the great victory in
which Tennesseans of another age played a leading part, and which contributed so
much to the destinies of the nation.</p>

<p>My Dear Mr. Folk:</p>
<p>I have carefully read and considered the report which you, as Chairman of the
Commission appointed in 1927 to examine the authorities as to the true value of the
Battle of New Orleans, are about to make to the Governor of Tennessee. Hitherto
I have had the privilege of conferring with you from time to time concerning the
important historical question involved in the investigation.</p>
<p>I have also read carefully the treatise prepared by you and which accompanies
your report to the Governor. It shows very thorough and judicious investigation, and
in my opinion very sound conclusions.</p>
<p>I fully concur with you in the conclusions stated in your report, as well as the
reasons therefor which you have therein set forth in lucid statement.</p>
<p>I do trust that this valuable work which you have done will be properly appreciated,
and that the errors which have so persistently appeared in the histories, particularly
the school histories, will be duly corrected, so that the fallacy that the
Battle of New Orleans was a useless battle and fought after the treaty of peace, will
no longer be accepted by anybody, and that truth will be known by all.</p>
<p><span class="center">Yours very truly,</span>

<p>My Dear Mr. Folk:</p>
<p>I have read with attention your excellent report on the Battle of New Orleans,
to be submitted to the Governor of Tennessee, in conjunction with the report of our
commission on the subject. I have ventured to indicate by question marks in two or
three places phrases or statements which I think could be changed to advantage.
These, however, are merely questions of verbiage, not of fact. In point of fact, I
think you have made a most interesting and important assemblage of the essential
points to be considered in connection with the Battle of New Orleans, and have shown
conclusively that the opinion so frequently expressed by historians, that the battle
was unnecessary, is a sentimental inaccuracy which ought to be corrected. You have
done a useful and important piece of work, and I congratulate you upon its completion.</p>
<p>May I beg you to be good enough to favor me with a copy when the work is
printed? I should like to prepare a review of it for one of our local newspapers.</p>
<p><span class="center">Yours very truly,</span>

<br /><span class="sc">An Interview Containing an Outline.</span></h2>
<p>It was the 8th of January. I sat down for lunch at a small table in
a Nashville hotel. Presently the head waiter conducted to a seat opposite
me a young man, seemingly about 22 years of age. He was a handsome,
wholesome looking young man, and had an air of self-reliance. He
impressed me at first sight as being a typical young American; at any
rate he was decidedly attractive to the narrator, whose grey head could
but reveal his advanced years.</p>
<p>While awaiting the lunches, a casual remark about the weather opened
conversation. A waiter brought an afternoon paper. On the front page
was a picture of Andrew Jackson, and big headlines over accounts of
celebrations in memory of the victory at New Orleans in 1815.</p>
<p>The young man, with the superiority of youthful knowledge, exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why all this to-do about a battle which was a needless one? It was
a brilliant victory, and salved American pride at the time; but that is
now four generations in the past. We should not go on salving our pride
over a useless victory, and especially when it was over a country now our
strong and perpetual friend. We don&rsquo;t need anything to boost our
pride any more. We are now the greatest nation on earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While responding to the fervor in the young man&rsquo;s last sentence, I
felt a kind of joy in his prelude, which I knew was based on history that
I knew to be false.</p>
<p>In brief explanation, let me say that for some years, I have been
engaged in research work as to the true value of the battle of New
Orleans, resulting in the conviction that the current appraisal in school
histories is entirely erroneous. I therefore welcomed the opportunity
to develop the truth to this typical young American. I decided upon
the gradual approach rather than a frontal attack, which might result in
amour propre resentment.</p>
<p>I said in a casual tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Permit me to take issue with you. Suppose I should tell you that
the Battle of New Orleans was not a needless battle; that it was, in fact,
the second most important military event in the life of our republic?
Suppose I should say to you that it was not fought after peace, but during
war?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man looked at me, first with a show of impatience, and
then with a tolerant air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My only answer,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;is that you haven&rsquo;t read our modern
histories. I have. The Peace Treaty of Ghent was signed Christmas
Eve, 1814. Sailing vessels were the quickest means of communication
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
at that time, and so it was more than six weeks before the news reached
our people. During that interim the Battle of New Orleans was fought.
So you see it was quite useless except as a contribution to American
pride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you read that treaty?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he responded, &ldquo;that is, I have read several reliable digests.
They all say the treaty was silent as to Impressment and Orders in
Council, which caused our declaration of war, and that it amounted to
a simple agreement to stop fighting and go back to the status before the
war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I was calculating on my next move the young man resumed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had a debate at school last year on the question, &lsquo;Resolved, that
the United States won the War of 1812.&rsquo; I took the ground that it was
a draw, and my side won. So you can see that I am well posted on
that war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had a polite, patronizing air, and this decided me upon a direct
blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I have also closely studied the events of this
War of 1812. I have read some more or less superficial comments on the
Peace Treaty of Ghent. I have also read the Treaty itself, word by word.
In precise specific terms, that document stipulated that it was not to be
effective until ratified by both sides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man gave an inquiring look, and commented:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That of course is important, if true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;You can verify the fact in fifteen minutes.
A few blocks from where we sit is a Carnegie Library in which you can
find a volume containing various treaties of the United States. The
Treaty of Ghent is among them. It is called the Treaty of Amity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask who you are?&rdquo; questioned the young man, with a changed
and puzzled mien.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a member of the Committee appointed by the State to make
research into the real value of the Battle of New Orleans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am delighted to know you,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;I love to discuss
history, which reveals the foundation of our existing social structure.
There are some questions I would like to ask of you. First, since the
Treaty was eventually ratified, aren&rsquo;t our historians while technically
wrong, in saying the Battle of New Orleans occurred after Peace, and
was a useless battle, really in the right, for the reason that the battle really
had no effect upon the Peace Treaty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;the Treaty adopted at Ghent, Dec. 24, 1814,
was ratified soon after its reception in Washington, and promulgated the
next day, Feb. 18, 1815. That was after the news of the victory at New
Orleans had reached Washington.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose the result at New Orleans had been different, would
President Madison have signed the Treaty?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a real question for college debate. It is a question calculated
to bring sharply to the student the picture of the distracted condition
of our country at the time. By signing the treaty Madison would
have appeased the New England section, then in hostile and threatening
attitude, but at the same time would have faced the surrender of the territory
west of the Mississippi for all time, or faced future negotiation or war.
By refusing to sign, the President would have prolonged the war with
its uncertainties. At the same time he would have confronted possible
disunion through the open disaffection of the northeastern states. The
English government construed the disaffection as a threat of secession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was planned by that calculating government, as evidence shows,
to inveigle New England into a separate treaty in case after British
capture and occupation of New Orleans, Madison should refuse to ratify
the Ghent treaty. Thus, if the issue in that New Orleans affair had been
different, President Madison would have faced danger of disunion, on
one side or the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be hard to conceive of a graver situation. All this was
averted, and gloriously averted, by the victory at New Orleans, the news
of which caused the treaty to be joyfully ratified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you overdrawn the picture?&rdquo; asked the young man. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
it a fact that the treaty provided for the return of all territory taken
during the war, so that, if the English had captured New Orleans they
would have given it up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear young friend,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I have not overdrawn the picture.
The mutual restoration clause provided that all territory, places
and possessions, taken by either, were to be returned at effective peace.
Bear in mind that England had never conceded the validity of our title
to the Louisiana Domain, and so if the carefully planned design to capture
it had been successful, England was in position to hold that she did not
regard it as a legal possession of the United States, and as not subject to
return under the Peace Treaty. It is a violence to credibility to suppose
that England, after finally dispatching the big expedition against Louisiana,
would within a few weeks thereafter, agree to a peace treaty, recalling
her troops from an anticipated successful conquest. In the light of
present knowledge, the peace proceedings show a studied purpose to
protect the expedition sent out to capture New Orleans. The supposition,
advanced by many historians, that if England had captured New Orleans,
she would have given it up, is a reflection upon the intelligence of the
English government of that period, and really, ascribes to that government
egregious asininity. Now, with all of her blunders, England has
never been asinine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man listened intently, gave an inhaled &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; and then
added:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;I begin to see; but there are some questions I want to ask. First,
when and why and how did this error get in history?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A natural inquiry,&rdquo; I responded. &ldquo;I cannot definitely answer, nor
is a definite answer vital. However, I will give one conjecture; Jackson
became a national figure as a result of the Battle of New Orleans. While
acclaimed by the masses, Jackson had many bitter enemies, some of them
in the history writing class. Prejudice may have caused disparagement
of the importance of the event upon which his national fame is founded.
But all that is of small importance beside the establishment of the actual
truth, that the battle was not fought after peace, but that it was necessary
to prevent England&rsquo;s conquest of Louisiana. Thus, as I have said before,
the Battle was the second most important military event in the life of the
Republic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now my other questions,&rdquo; said the young man; &ldquo;why has such an
error been allowed to go unchallenged all these generations?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another natural question,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;It is a question that must
come to every mind in approaching this matter of clarification. I am
not able to answer this question definitely, just as I was not able to answer
your other question with any degree of certainty. The answer is not
vital, except from the standpoint of the problem involved, of overcoming
the inertia of a long-enthroned lie. My conjecture is that the false appraisal
began when civil upheaval was imminent, and when most people
were thinking only of the present&mdash;a state of mind which was continued
for a long time. So the viewpoint of prejudice, unopposed, gradually
crept into accepted history. There have been, and are, students of history
adhering to the great fact that the Battle of New Orleans saved the
Louisiana purchase, or another war with England. But school histories
continue to purvey the false viewpoint to the youth of the land. But
&lsquo;truth is mighty and will prevail,&rsquo; and the time has now come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point a bell boy brought me a card, and I arose to bid goodbye
to my young friend, saying;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have come for me, to go to the Hermitage for the exercises
being held there today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish it were so you could take me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I arranged to do so, very much pleased at this change in his attitude.</p>

<p>There is no nobler calling than that of the school teachers of America,
who are ministering to the instruction and development of the future
citizens and leaders of the Republic. These teachers are bound to be
deeply concerned when they find that through school histories furnished
them, they have been imparting a falsehood about an important event
in United States history&mdash;the Battle of New Orleans, fought January 8,
1815. These school histories minimize the value of the battle, describing
it as needless, because fought after peace, when as a fact, the battle was
not fought after peace, and the victory, in fact, prevented a carefully
planned conquest of the then lately acquired Louisiana Domain, with all
the attendant, untoward complications, another war being one of them.</p>
<p>It is the purpose of this volume to show by reliable authorities, the
truth as to the value of this battle.</p>
<p>History, as is well known, is honey-combed with lies, originally projected
either in ignorance, prejudice or adulation. We are always fortunate
if able to arrest and correct one before too late.</p>
<p>The Legislature of Tennessee, at its session of 1927, adopted the following
resolution:</p>
<p>&ldquo;WHEREAS, the Battle of New Orleans, fought on January 8, 1815,
is one of the outstanding military events of American History; and,</p>
<p>&ldquo;WHEREAS, the memory of the great American victory achieved
there, is especially cherished by Tennesseans because of Andrew Jackson,
and the other Tennesseans who therein immortalized themselves; and,</p>
<p>&ldquo;WHEREAS, school histories, adopted for and taught in our schools,
convey the impression that the battle was a needless one in that it occurred
fifteen days after the treaty of Peace had been signed at Ghent, Belgium,
by the Commissioners representing the United States and England; and,</p>
<p>&ldquo;WHEREAS, serious criticism is made that such textbooks present
an erroneous appraisement of the value of the battle, by omitting the
reference to an essential fact, to-wit: that England did not construe the
Peace Treaty of Ghent as applicable to Louisiana, for the reason that she
held as invalid the title of the United States to that Domain, conveyed
by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1803; and,</p>
<p>&ldquo;WHEREAS, it is of prime importance that our school children should
receive every essential truth from historical textbooks, and especially those
textbooks placed in the hands of Tennessee students should portray in
its true significance the battle of New Orleans in which the ancestors
of so many were engaged; Now,</p>
<p>&ldquo;THEREFORE, be it resolved by the Senate, the House of Representatives
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
concurring, that the Governor be, and is hereby empowered
and authorized, to appoint five, or in his discretion seven, persons of known
historical knowledge and research, who shall constitute a Commission,
charged with the duty of carefully examining the authorities, touching
the true value of the Battle of New Orleans, fought January 8, 1815; and,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Said Commission shall incorporate its conclusions and recommendations
in a report to the Governor who shall transmit the same to the Legislature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The present writer, who was appointed a member of the authorized
Committee, has been engaged in making research into the matter involved,
and has found facts, not hard of access, which should, and will, when
understood, force a radical revision of school histories in the version they
present as to the value of the New Orleans victory.</p>
<p>Other members of the Commission appointed by the Governor were:
John H. DeWitt, of Nashville, Judge of the Tennessee Court of Appeals
and president of the Tennessee Historical Society; John Trotwood Moore,
of Nashville, State Librarian and historian; Claude G. Bowers, New
York, author, historian, and editor&mdash;now ambassador to Spain; John S.
Kendall, of New Orleans, historian and professor in Tulane University.</p>
<p>It is the purpose of the writer, after submission for comment to his
distinguished fellow Committeemen, to make this volume the basis of
report to the Governor of Tennessee for transmission to the Legislature.</p>
<p>In order to present, in as simple a way as possible, the case, or the
indictment, for such it is, actual and authenticated excerpts are given
herewith from all the American histories prescribed for Tennessee Public
Schools by the State Text Book Commission.</p>
<p>These extracts were obtained from the office of the Secretary of State,

<br /><span class="sc">What School Histories Teach.</span></h2>
<p>Here are the extracts from the Tennessee authorized school Histories:</p>
<p>School History of Tennessee: S. E. Scates, page 225:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though the battle resulted in great victory for the Americans, it
was sad indeed that so many brave men lost their lives at New Orleans
quite uselessly. At Ghent, Belgium, a treaty of peace for the war of
1812 had been signed Christmas Eve, 1814. Because messages travelled
so slowly, by sailing vessels, news of peace did not reach New Orleans
until after the fighting had taken place.&rdquo;</p>
<hr />
<p>A History of American Government and Culture: Harold Rugg,
page 192:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two weeks after the Treaty of Peace had been signed, another battle
was fought. This may seem strange to you, but in those days transportation
and communication was so slow that news of the making of peace
reached the country long after it had happened.&rdquo;</p>
<hr />
<p>History of the United States: Beard &amp; Beard, page 238:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Treaty of Peace. Both countries were in truth sick of a war
that offered neither glory nor profit. So after an exchange of notes they
sent representatives to Ghent to discuss a settlement. Long negotiations
were finally ended by an agreement on Christmas Eve, 1814, a few days
before Jackson&rsquo;s victory at New Orleans. When the treaty reached
America the people were surprised to find it said nothing about the
seizure of American sailors, the destruction of American trade, the searching
for American ships, or the support of Indians on the frontier. Nevertheless,
we are told, the public &lsquo;passed from gloom to glory&rsquo; on the
arrival of the news of peace. Bells were rung; schools were closed; flags
were displayed; and many a rousing toast was drunk in taverns and
private homes. The rejoicing could continue. With Napoleon definitely
beaten at Waterloo in June, 1815, Great Britain had no more need to
impress sailors, search ships, and seize American goods bound to the
Continent. Once more the terrible sea power sank into the background
and the ocean was again white with the sails of merchantmen.&rdquo;</p>
<hr />
<p>History of the American People: Latane, page 284:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jackson&rsquo;s brilliant victory at the Battle of New Orleans caused great
rejoicing throughout the country, but it did not affect the outcome of the
war, for the treaty of peace had been signed at Ghent two weeks before
it was fought. Its effect on the course of American history, however, was
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
far-reaching, for it brought the West into greater prominence and made
Andrew Jackson the military hero and political leader of that section.&rdquo;</p>
<hr />
<p>A History of the People of the United States: Waddy Thompson,
page 220:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Treaty of Peace; Results of the War: The great victory of New
Orleans was won after peace had been made. A treaty had been signed
at Ghent, Belgium, on December 24, 1814. But as only sailing vessels
then crossed the ocean, and as about six weeks were required for the
voyage, news of peace did not reach America until February, 1815.&rdquo;</p>
<hr />
<p>First Book in United States History: Waddy Thompson, page 253:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Victory after Peace: Brilliant as was the victory at New Orleans,
it was won after peace had been made between the United States and
Great Britain. Both sides having become tired of the War, a treaty
of peace was signed in Belgium in December, 1814; while the Battle of
New Orleans was fought on January 8, 1815. Steamboats did not then
cross the Ocean, and no electric cable connected America with Europe, so
news of the treaty did not reach America until a month after the Battle
of New Orleans.&rdquo;</p>
<hr />
<p>The American People: Muzzey, page 218:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jackson, henceforth, the &lsquo;Hero of New Orleans&rsquo; was rewarded in the
following years by the command against the Indians of Florida (1817),
the governorship of Florida territory (1821); a seat in the United States
Senate (1823), and the Presidency of the United States (1829). If the
Atlantic cable had existed in 1814, it would have brought the news of
the treaty of peace in time to turn Pakenham&rsquo;s expedition back from the
Mississippi, to prevent the bloodiest battle that had ever been fought on
American soil, and perhaps to keep from the pages of American history
the administration of the most masterful of our Presidents between Washington
and Lincoln.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV.</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Falsehood Shown by the Records.</span></h2>
<p>The unanimity of view presented by these extracts from Tennessee
adopted histories, gives justification for the assumption that the same view
obtains throughout the United States. In partial extenuation of school
historians and of Textbook Commissions, it may be said that they have
followed the lead of most generally recognized historians. But any trusting
follower of the pack leaders could have ascertained, without much
trouble, that the battle of New Orleans was NOT fought after peace.
It occurred fifteen days after the Treaty of Ghent had been signed by
the Commissioners of the two interested nations, but expressly, by the
terms of that treaty, it was not to be effective until ratified by both sides
and ratification exchanged in Washington.</p>
<p>Let us go to specific quotations. The Peace Treaty of Ghent, dated
December 24, 1814, contained, as its first sentence, the following words:
&ldquo;All hostilities, both by sea and by land shall cease as soon as this treaty
shall be ratified by both parties as hereinafter mentioned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Article XI of the Treaty reads: &ldquo;This Treaty, when the same shall
be ratified on both sides, without alteration by either of the contracting
parties, and the ratification mutually exchanged, shall be binding on both
parties; and the ratification shall be exchanged at Washington, in the
space of four months from this date, or sooner if practicable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Further, the record shows that ratification of the Treaty was advised
by the United States Senate, February 16, 1815; that it was ratified February
17; and ratification exchanged the same day, and that it was promulgated
February 18th.</p>
<p>The Treaty of Ghent, called the Treaty of Amity, is preserved, of
course, among American State papers. A copy may be found in a public
library in a volume devoted to Treaties, Agreements, Etc. between the
U. S. A. and other Powers, Compiled by W. M. Maloy, Under Resolution
of U. S. Senate of Jan. 18, 1909.</p>
<p>A lawyer friend of the writer, with whom he discussed the situation,
suggested that while manifestly in error in representing the Battle as
having been fought after peace, that a plea in abatement might be offered
for the historians to the effect that the treaty was subsequently ratified
as written; that the Battle of New Orleans had no effect upon the Treaty;
that it further was needless because if its issue had been different the
British under the mutual restoration clause of the Ghent Treaty would,
upon promulgation of the Treaty, have evacuated New Orleans and
Louisiana.</p>
<p>That viewpoint is entitled to such consideration as should be given
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
any viewpoint based solely on assumption, but it and all such viewpoints
must be subjected to acid judgment based on co-related facts.</p>
<p>As to the first point above made, it is a matter of record that the
treaty was ratified quickly after reaching Washington; it is also a matter
of record that the news of the great American victory at New Orleans
reached the Capitol ten days before. As to the second point, that the
battle had no effect upon the treaty, a wide range of discussion, based
on records, is opened, which will be presented later.</p>
<p>As to the third point, that the battle was needless because, if successful,
the British would have evacuated New Orleans and Louisiana upon promulgation
of the Peace Treaty, it may be stated here that the records
which will be presently laid before the reader give decided negation to
that assumption.</p>
<p>The writer boldly avers, as supported truth, that the British Government,
never having acknowledged the validity of the title of the United
States to Louisiana, secretly dispatched the big expedition against New
Orleans with one hand, while directing peace negotiations with the other;
that it was the British purpose to seize and hold Louisiana, nominally
in the name of Spain; and that the British Government would never have
agreed to a peace treaty, which did not contain a clause, no matter how
subtly garbed, that would not give justification to the British retention
of Louisiana.</p>
<p>However, before going into the matter of citations of authorities and
records, it is due to the reader to present something of the English attitude
at the time, so that he may see more clearly and with more understanding
its actions. That can best be done by brief picture of the background
of that period.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER V.</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Background&mdash;Louisiana.</span></h2>
<p>The great domain, christened Louisiana, was taken over by La Salle
in 1682, in the name of France. It remained under French dominion
until 1763, when, as a result of French-English wars, France retired from
the New World. It seemed inevitable that Louisiana, great unexplored
trans-river territory, would fall into English hands. But France ceded
Louisiana to Spain, then still a world power. In 1800 Napoleon Bonaparte
caused Spain to re-cede Louisiana to France. In 1803 Bonaparte
sold Louisiana to the United States. He was about to engage in war
with England, and historians generally agree that the sale to United
States was made because he recognized the difficulty of defending the
remote territory against the English Navy. The British Encyclopedia
says the sale was made to keep Louisiana from falling into English hands.
Thus it appears, that England was justified in feeling that Louisiana for
the second time had been maneuvered from her ownership.</p>
<p>References without number may be given from histories covering that
period. The writer has before him James G. Blaine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Twenty Years
in Congress,&rdquo; which in Chapter 1 of the first volume (pages 3 to 13)
deals comprehensively with the relation of the Louisiana purchase to the
early days of the Republic. Some key quotations are here presented:
&ldquo;She (France) in 1763, now gave up Canada and Cape Breton, acknowledged
the sovereignty of Great Britain in the original thirteen colonies
as extending to the Mississippi, and, by a separate treaty, surrendered
Louisiana on the west side of the Mississippi, with New Orleans on the
east side, to Spain. She (Spain) continued in possession of Louisiana
until the year 1800, when Bonaparte concluded a Treaty ..., by
which the entire territory was retroceded to France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, Mr. Blaine says: &ldquo;Fearing that in the threatening conflict
(1803) England, by her superior Naval force, would deprive him of his
newly acquired colonial empire, and greatly enhance her own prestige
by securing all the American possessions, which France had owned prior
to 1763, Bonaparte, by a dash in diplomacy, as quick and as brilliant
as his tactics on the field of battle, placed Louisiana beyond the reach of
the British power. In a tone of vehemence and passion he said: &lsquo;I know
the full value of Louisiana. A few lines of a treaty have restored it to
me, and now I must expect to lose it. The English expect to take possession
of it, and it is thus they will begin the war. They have already
twenty ships of the line in the Gulf of Mexico. The conquest of Louisiana
will be easy. I have not a moment to lose in putting it out of their reach.
The English have successively taken from France the Canadas, Cape
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
Breton, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and the richest portion of Asia.
But they shall not have the Mississippi, which they covet.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again quoting from Blaine: &ldquo;England&rsquo;s acquisition of Louisiana
would have proved in the highest degree embarrassing, if not disastrous
to the Union. No colonial acquisition ever made by her on any continent
has been so profitable to her commerce, and so strengthening to her military
position, as that of Louisiana would have proved. The fact was
clearly seen by Bonaparte when he hastily made the treaty ceding it to
the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Blaine: &ldquo;The conflict of arms (War of 1812) did not occur
until nine years after; and it is a curious and not unimportant fact, that
the most notable defeat of the British troops in the second war of independence,
as the struggle of 1812 has been well named, occurred on the
soil of the territory for whose protection the original precaution had been
taken by Jefferson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reader will find all of the chapter referred to very interesting
as indeed will be any chapter devoted to our sudden acquisition of the
immense domain called Louisiana.</p>
<p>The striking sentences quoted above serve to emphasize the fact that
it would not have been unnatural for England to have felt resentment
at this second maneuvering of a vast territory from her grasp. Some
historians have expressed surprise that England did not at once undertake
to take Louisiana, the United States notwithstanding. That would
have meant armed conflict with America at a time of the war in Europe.
Besides, and this is a deduction of the present writer, such a course would
have placed upon England the onus before the world of a war of conquest
in the western continent. So England waited.</p>
<p>An additional viewpoint is here presented: In the history of the
United States of America, by Henry W. Elson, under the caption
&ldquo;Louisiana&rdquo; (Vol. 2, page 230) appears the following paragraph (page
233): &ldquo;Actual possession soon placed our title to Louisiana beyond dispute;
but strictly speaking, the sale was not legal. Napoleon had agreed
to convey to Spain a dukedom on the Arno River, for the son-in-law
of the Spanish King, in payment for Louisiana; but the price was never
paid. The treaty of Ildefonso also stipulated that France should never
cede the territory to any foreign power; but Napoleon disregarded this.
In point of fact, France, therefore, did not own Louisiana; and even if
she had owned it, the cession, according to the French Constitution, could
not be made without the consent of the Chamber of Deputies, and this
the First Consul never obtained and never sought. The French people
were astonished at this action of their ruler; but he was a master, and
they were powerless. Far sadder was the wail from Spain. The Spanish
Government protested briefly, pathetically; but its voice was not heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the above quotation the reader can appreciate England&rsquo;s attitude,
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
as to the legality of the United States&rsquo; title to Louisiana, maintained
until January 8, 1815, when the highest law known to nations
dissipated that attitude forever.</p>
<p>There are doubtless many today, as we bask in the enjoyment of National
security and other national blessings, who do not appreciate the
vastness, the importance, of the Louisiana domain, the acquisition of which
Dr. Sloane of Princeton says translated our young republic into a world
power. According to an early authority the domain comprised 829,987
square miles, and by later authority over a million square miles. In the
Louisiana Purchase territory are today comprehended the following
states: Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota,
Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South
Dakota, Washington and Wyoming.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI.</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Background&mdash;Impressment.</span></h2>
<p>The impressment policy of the English Government applied to the
new American country, was very galling. Under that policy American
ships were stopped on the high seas, and seamen taken from them under
guise of being British deserters. Many good Americans were forced into
British service. The young victim country protested. In 1801 the impressment
practice fell off and seemingly was abandoned. (See Elson&rsquo;s
History of the U. S., pages 246 to 252, Vol. 2.) A quotation is given
from Elson, page 247, Vol. 2: &ldquo;This (impressment) practice had fallen
into the background during the short season of peace between France
and England, that ended in 1803, but with the renewal of the war it
had been revived with alarming vigor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether that &ldquo;alarming vigor&rdquo; was due entirely to war exigencies
of recruiting its Navy, or whether the British Government designed it
as a provocation to the young western Republic, to take the onus of declaring
war, under guise of which the coveted floating title to Louisiana
could be appropriated, is a matter for deduction, not appearing of record.</p>
<p>At any rate, the impressment practice re-aroused resentment in the
young republic, and that resentment found chief expression in the then
Southwest, resulting under the leadership of that section and over the
opposition of the New England States, or rather of that of the assertive
Federalists therein, in a declaration of war against England, on the
ground of the degradation of our sovereignty.</p>
<p>It is not the purpose of the writer to discuss the War of 1812, except
as its events may relate to his mission, that of correcting falsehood and
error in the historical books adopted as textbooks for the school children
of America.</p>
<p>The War of 1812 was heralded as a mistake by the Federalists, opponents
of the then administration. While the incipient Navy gave a brilliant
account of itself, justifying the proud boast that man for man and
gun for gun, the U. S. Navy was the equal of anything afloat, for two
and a half years the record shows that land events in the main were untoward,
climaxed by the capture, and sacking and burning of the public
buildings, of the National Capital in August, 1814, and thus the Federal
Press offensively took the &ldquo;I-told-you-so&rdquo; attitude.</p>
<p>Early in the war the Emperor of Russia extended his good offices as
mediator. The United States Government accepted the offer, being earnestly
desirous of honorable peace, and having nothing to conceal from
neutral investigation. But the English government declined the Russian
offer, indicating that it preferred to treat direct. Later as a result of
British invitation, a Peace Commission met at Ghent, Belgium.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII.</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Negotiations at Ghent.</span></h2>
<p>A separate chapter is devoted to the joint conference at Ghent because
therein is shown the subtle, diplomatically concealed, purpose of
the then English Government. The record of the proceedings of the
conference, in order to be fully understood, should be read in the light of
the afterwards revealed fact that, at the same time these negotiations
were being conducted, the expedition against Louisiana was secretly
planned and dispatched. Things that are puzzling in the making often
become clear in the aftermath. And so it is in this case.</p>
<p>The defeat and resultant abdication of Napoleon (April 4, 1814)
released England&rsquo;s European troops for pursuing the American war with
greater vigor, and to punish the United States for having declared war
at England&rsquo;s most embarrassing moment. It would not be a violent assumption
to say that at least some members of the British Government
felt that the time was opportune at last to take Louisiana and thus redress
a grievance nurtured since 1803, when Bonaparte snatched that great
domain from England&rsquo;s outstretched hands.</p>
<p>The exact date on which the Louisiana expedition was determined
upon is not material. Plain evidence discloses that during the joint
peace negotiation its details were arranged and the army sent forward
to take New Orleans. We now know that after the capture of Washington
by the British and the burning and sacking of the public buildings
there (August 24, 1814), the British invading forces, after being later
repulsed in an attack upon Baltimore, repaired under orders to Nigril
Bay, Jamaica, to await recruits for the expedition against New Orleans.
With the time then required for ocean travel, these orders must have been
given prior to, or about the time of the meeting of the Peace Commissioners
at Ghent, August 4, 1814.</p>
<p>Let us visualize the two groups assembled at Ghent. First, consider
the five Americans. They were earnestly desirous of a quick and honorable
peace. Their country was riven with dissatisfaction produced by
a powerful anti-administration and anti-war party, seemingly in control
of the northeastern states, making dire threats, unless hostilities were soon
ended.</p>
<p>The American Commissioners were prepared and authorized to forego
the questions of impressment and orders in council, which caused the war,
and conclude a peace pact on the basis of the status before the war. For
a month they had been waiting the coming of the British Commissioners.
It is evident there was a purpose on the part of the British Government
to delay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>The second group consisted of three suave English Commissioners,
who appeared at Ghent, as before stated, August 4th.</p>
<p>These English Commissioners began by making, on behalf of their
Government, demands objectionable and humiliating, the discussion of
which, often at long distance with the London Government officials, consumed
time. Finally the American Commissioners were forced to write
to Washington for further instructions.</p>
<p>From &ldquo;The Diplomacy of the War of 1812,&rdquo; by Frank A. Updyke,
which is a most valuable account of the Peace conference, quotation is
given from pages 220 and 221. &ldquo;It was the unanimous opinion of the
American ministers that Great Britain&rsquo;s policy was to consume as much
time as possible before the termination of negotiations, in order that some
decided victory might be gained in the war which would make it easier
for her to insist upon her demands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This quotation is given to show that our ministers recognized the
British tactics as sparring for time; but the record does not show that
any one of them thought of New Orleans as the objective point of British
design.</p>
<p>The records in connection with the negotiations are voluminous, and
make very interesting reading. But viewed in the after revealed facts,
the truth stands out so clearly that the proceedings of the Peace Conference
in English consideration and the secret expedition to capture New
Orleans were so closely inter-related that in arriving at the material
verity, much material in that conference should be disregarded as intended
by the English to delay and becloud, and so matters coming before
the Conference referring to Louisiana should only be considered in connection
with our mission.</p>
<p>Frank A. Updyke, Ph.D. of Dartmouth College, in his &ldquo;The Diplomacy
of the War of 1812,&rdquo; quoted from above, has given a condensed,
fully annotated, account of the proceedings of the Peace Conference. It
is a work, published in 1915, which deserves place as a supplementary
textbook in every college and high school. I have made liberal use of
Dr. Updyke&rsquo;s volume, which merits high place for research effort and
reference.</p>
<p>The Joint Commission had been in session a little over two months when
the first note was struck significant of the British underlying purpose.
It was in the communication of the English Government through their
ministers to the American Commissioners. The document was dated
October 8, 1814. (See American State papers.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first paragraph,&rdquo; says Updyke (page 269), &ldquo;attempted to show
the illegality of the purchase of Louisiana and the spirit of territorial
aggrandisement on the part of the United States which this act manifested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It might have been inferred that this attack upon the legality of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
title to Louisiana would be followed by a demand of some sort; but no
such demand was made. In fact, the treaty as finally adopted, contained
no mention of Louisiana.</p>
<p>It is highly pertinent to ask a question as to what was the purpose
of this attack upon the title of Louisiana. All such things have a purpose.</p>
<p>In the light of present knowledge that purpose is clear. The great
expedition against New Orleans being near completion, it is obvious that
the British Government recognized the good diplomatic position before
the world, after the capture of Louisiana, of showing a record of fair
warning as justification for retention.</p>
<p>The reply of the Americans to the note of October 8th was dated
October 13th. (See American State papers.)</p>
<p>Quotation is given from Updyke, page 284:</p>
<p>&ldquo;While endeavoring to make the reply brief, the American ministers
could not refrain from discussing some other topics adverted to by the
British in their note. The British ministers had made the charge that the
acquisition of Louisiana by the United States was illegal, Spain having
offered a remonstrance against its cession and the right of France to
make it. To this the American note responded that, although the Spanish
minister at Washington had made such remonstrance, at that very time
orders were given by Spain for the delivery of Louisiana to France. So
France was in actual possession of the territory when she disposed of it
to the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another matter, although not in chronological turn, may be here presented,
as showing further the English attitude towards Louisiana. In
the course of the note of the Americans to the British, dated November
10, 1814 (see American State papers), Updyke says, page 307: &ldquo;The
American note refused to consent to the British proposal to fix the northwest
boundary by the line from the lake of the Woods to the Mississippi
unless the boundaries of Louisiana should also be provided for in the
settlement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The British ministers in referring the note to their Government, said
they were unwilling to consent to a discussion of the Louisiana boundary,
for their doing so might be taken as a recognition of the right of the
United States to the occupation of the territory. (See Updyke, page 310.)</p>
<p>What might be called the Uti Possidetis scheme was embraced in a
British note of October 21st (see American State papers). The British
proposed the Uti Possidetis principle, as a basis of settlement, under
which each side would keep what territory it should be possessed of at
the promulgation of peace.</p>
<p>The reason behind this proposal seems now very patent. The adoption
of this principle would have enabled England, by indisputable treaty
right, to retain Louisiana, which she confidently expected to take.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>But the Americans opposed this principle and firmly insisted on a
treaty based upon conditions at the beginning of the war.</p>
<p>The English were very insistent and for a time there appeared a new
danger that the conference would break up. But, as will appear later,
British diplomacy, the most skilful in the world, found a way to accomplish
the main objective of the Uti Possidetis; that is to say, the retention
of Louisiana after the expected reduction of New Orleans.</p>
<p>While these peace negotiations were simmering at Ghent, the well-planned,
secret expedition against New Orleans was completed in detail,
and with confident feeling of assurance that, because of its size and
veteran fibre, it would be invincible, it was finally put on its way to
join the waiting troops at Nigril Bay, Jamaica. Sir Edward Pakenham
was appointed Commander of the Expeditionary forces. A. C. Buell,
in his &ldquo;History of Andrew Jackson,&rdquo; published in 1904, states that Pakenham&rsquo;s
order was dated November 4, 1814, and read according to English
war office minute; that General Pakenham &ldquo;shall proceed to Plymouth
and embark there for Louisiana to assume command of the forces operating
for the reduction of that province.&rdquo; Buell cites as authority Bathurst
papers; State Paper Office, London.</p>
<p>On the assumption of the correctness of Buell&rsquo;s citation, the term
&ldquo;Province&rdquo; as applied to Louisiana, in English official orders, represents
the radical difference of viewpoint as to Louisiana at the time between
the British Government and the American Union, of which the English
termed province was a fair possession from which already one state had
been carved. (Louisiana in 1812.)</p>
<p>While the British Expedition was ploughing the seas, unexpected resistance
was forming under an American general, who didn&rsquo;t know what
defeat was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII.</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Negotiations at Ghent&mdash;Continued.</span></h2>
<p>We will now return to the parleys at Ghent. The British continued
to insist on the Uti Possidetis as a basis of a Peace Treaty, but proposed
that it be &ldquo;subject to such modifications as mutual convenience may be
found to require.&rdquo; In a letter to the British Commissioners, dated October
18th, Lord Bathurst, quoted by Updyke (page 288), cited several
points on which mutual accommodations might be had; but Louisiana was
not one of the points. For if it had been there would have seemingly
been no use planning and sending out the great expedition for the &ldquo;reduction
of that province.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From many interesting details touching the Uti Possidetis proposals,
the reader is referred to Updyke (&ldquo;The Diplomacy of the War of 1812&rdquo;),
pages 288 to 319.</p>
<p>Finally, realizing the unshaken adherence of the Americans to the
antebellum status, the British gave up the Uti Possidetis demand, and by
specific wording obviously sought to protect the Louisiana design.</p>
<p>In the amended proposal of the British (see British to American
ministers Nov. 26, 1814), there are two things highly pertinent to the
inquiry we are conducting, to establish the real value of the Battle of
New Orleans. The first was the provision that peace would not be effective
until after ratification by both countries. The second consisted in
the proposed wording for the mutual restoration clause as follows: &ldquo;Belonging
to either party, taken by the other.&rdquo; The effect of this wording
in the mutual restoration clause, would have been that all territory belonging
to either party, taken by the other, should be returned. But this
would not embrace Louisiana, for from the English standpoint, it did
not legally belong to the United States.</p>
<p>As to the first point, a quotation is here given from Updyke (page
317): &ldquo;The amended project returned by the British commissioners provided
that the notification for the cessation of the war be issued after
ratifications of the treaty should have been exchanged rather than at the
time of the signature. This was designed, it was supposed, to give time
for the completion of the British plans against New Orleans, the successful
outcome of which was never doubted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The American ministers, on November 30th, consented to the substitution
of the day of exchange of ratifications for that of the signature
of the treaty, as the time for cessation of hostilities, and for regulating
the period when prizes at sea shall be restored. (See American to British
ministers, Nov. 30, 1814.)</p>
<p>This agreement was duly carried into the treaty, as we have heretofore
set forth, Article XI, prescribing all details.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>The American ministers opposed the proposed words in the mutual
restoration clause, &ldquo;belonging to either party, taken by the other.&rdquo; They
insisted on the words, &ldquo;taken by either party from the other.&rdquo; Strong
reasons were given by the Americans for their attitude, but the British
ministers refused to yield, saying the matter would be referred to their
Government (Updyke, pp. 324-325).</p>
<p>The British Government, on December 6th, instructed their Commissioners
to insist upon the retention of the words in dispute, and advanced
skilful arguments, in which the real purpose was not revealed. For a
digest of these arguments, see Updyke, pages 335-336.</p>
<p>To the present day reader, having knowledge of the expedition, which
was then on its way to capture New Orleans, the English purpose seems
very manifest.</p>
<p>With diplomatic art the British Government sought to make it appear
that the disputed words, &ldquo;belonging to either party and taken by the
other,&rdquo; were founded in the objective relating to the islands in Passamaquoddy
Bay during the time of the agreed upon reference to a commission
to determine the ownership of these Islands.</p>
<p>The Americans, not aware, of course, of the expedition against New
Orleans, accepted the viewpoint advanced as to the disputed words, but
while rejecting the words, indicated that they would be &ldquo;willing to admit
such a modification as should secure the right of Great Britain from being
affected or impaired by yielding possession of the Islands to the United
States.&rdquo; (Updyke, p. 343.)</p>
<p>The British ministers replied, arguing England&rsquo;s position. That position
in effect was, that during the war she had taken these islands, the
title to which was in dispute, and that to call upon her to restore them,
because they were occupied by the United States at the beginning of the
war, would be unjust; that having agreed to a commission to settle the
ownership of the islands, she was willing, if need be, to accede to a
clause which would especially guard the ultimate right against the prejudice
which the American ministers feared might arise from the continued
possession by Great Britain. The British ministers admitted the comparatively
small value of the territory in question, but claimed that yielding
possession of the Islands involved a point of honor on the part of
Great Britain, and, if insisted upon, might make the conclusion of peace
impossible. (See Updyke, pp. 343-344; report of conference of Dec. 12,
1814, given by British Commissioners to Lord Castlereagh.)</p>
<p>The Americans yielded the point, and thus it appears that the British
Government secured the accession of the principle of the great concealed
objective on a matter of minor importance. Thus the word &ldquo;possessions&rdquo;
was admitted into the mutual restoration clause of the peace treaty.</p>
<p>That mutual restoration clause, as adopted, and incorporated in Article
1, of the Treaty of Ghent, reads as follows:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;All territory, places and possessions whatsoever, taken by either party
from the other during the War, or which may be taken after the signing
of this Treaty, excepting only the Islands hereinafter mentioned, shall
be restored without delay and without causing any destruction or carrying
away of any of the artillery or other public property originally captured
in the said forts or places, and which shall remain therein upon the
exchange of the ratification of this Treaty, or any slaves or other private
property; and all archives, records, deeds, and papers, either of a public
nature or belonging to private persons, which, in the course of the War,
may have fallen into the hands of the officers, of either party shall be,
as far as may be practicable, forthwith restored and delivered to the proper
authorities and persons to whom they respectively belong. Such of the
Islands in the Bay of Passamaquoddy as are claimed by both parties,
shall remain in the possession of the party in whose occupation they may
be at the time of the exchange of the ratification of this Treaty until the
decision respecting the title to said islands shall have been made in conformity
with the fourth article of this Treaty. No disposition made by
this Treaty as to such possession of such islands and territories claimed
by both parties shall, in any manner whatever, be construed to affect the
right of either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Treaty, from which the clause above is quoted, can of course be
found in Washington, but copy may be seen at almost any general public
library, in the volume herebefore referred to containing various Treaties
of the United States.</p>
<p>The reader, who has been following us in our showing of the various
stages of the development of the British design to protect, by diplomacy,
the Louisiana expedition, will recognize the significance of the word &ldquo;possessions.&rdquo;
By reason of that word, the British were in position to maintain,
after capturing Louisiana, that it was not subject to return under
the mutual restoration clause adopted, not being, under English construction,
a legal &ldquo;possession&rdquo; of the United States, formal notice of that
construction having been given in the treaty negotiations. The subtly
accomplished insertion of the word in the treaty represented a triumph
of ulterior British diplomatic design over the very able, hard-headed, but
open and candid American commissioners, who were entirely in the dark
as to the Expedition dispatched to seize Louisiana.</p>
<p>That word was of course not as exclusive of argument as the Uti
Possidetis principle first proposed, and insisted upon almost as a sine
qua non; nor was it as clear as the wording subsequently urged, &ldquo;belonging
to either party and taken by the other&rdquo;; but it was all sufficient, backed
by the British conviction that Louisiana was not a legal possession of the
United States, and supported by the mighty British martial power, then
unleashed from European war.</p>
<p>It is obvious to the writer that but for the word &ldquo;possessions,&rdquo; or
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
wording of similar import, the treaty would not have been agreed to by
the British; in fact, such indication was given by the British ministers
at the joint conference December 12th, under the guise of the principle
pertaining to the Passamaquoddy Islands.</p>
<p>Any presumption that Great Britain, after planning the great expedition
against Louisiana, would have, within a few weeks following the
final dispatch of the military forces, signed a peace treaty, recalling those
forces from an attained, long-dreamed-of conquest, is a reflection upon
the intelligence of the British Government of 1814-15.</p>
<p>With the treaty agreed to, the English Government became anxious
about its ratification by President Madison. Significant evidence of this
is furnished by Doctor Updyke, in his work from which we have already
made a number of quotations. On page 355, Updyke says, &ldquo;The British
ministry had hoped that their last communication would enable the commissioners
to close the negotiations for the treaty of peace. They were,
however, suspicious of President Madison, and feared he would not sign
the treaty. For this reason it was stipulated that the war should not cease
until after the exchange of ratifications at Washington. They counted
upon having a strong English fleet in the Chesapeake and the Delaware
at the time that Baker, the bearer of the British copy of the treaty, should
reach Washington; and they also counted upon the disposition of the
Eastern states to secede from the Union, as likely to &lsquo;frighten Madison.&rsquo;
It was suggested that if Madison should refuse to ratify the treaty the
British Government should immediately propose to make a separate treaty
with the New England States, which it was believed could be accomplished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Updyke gives as authority for the foregoing paragraph: &ldquo;Liverpool
to Castlereagh, December 23, 1814; Wellington Supplementary Dispatches,
IX, 495.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Liverpool was prime minister and Lord Castlereagh was secretary
for foreign affairs.</p>
<p>The digest given of correspondence between these high English Government
officials makes it plain that the English Government was anxious
for ratification of the Peace Treaty and that they were fearful that Madison
would not sign.</p>
<p>As confirmatory of the Liverpool apprehension it may be mentioned
that the <i>London Times</i>, December 31, 1814 (see British Museum), said
that the ratification by Madison depended upon the outcome of the expedition
against New Orleans. The <i>London Times</i> was unfriendly to the
Liverpool government, and was also very hostile to the United States. In
the circumstances it may fairly be presumed that to allay criticism of
the treaty the press was informed of the expected New Orleans coup.</p>
<p>In view of the unanimous action of the American Commissioners in
agreeing to the Treaty, it becomes very evident that the British Government
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
anticipated that something would transpire before the Treaty
reached Washington that might cause the President to withhold his approval.
In the light of present knowledge, that something was the expected
British capture of New Orleans. We may well ask the question,
as to why the British Government was so anxious for the ratification of
the Treaty as to plan to &ldquo;frighten Madison&rdquo; and threaten separate peace
with New England, thus disrupting the Union, if that Government expected
to turn back Louisiana after its anticipated conquest. That question
carries its own obvious answer.</p>
<p>Happily for us, and for England as consequences have proved, and
for the world, the dilemma in which the English statesmen thought President
Madison would be placed, was averted.</p>
<p>While Carroll, with the American copy of the Treaty, and Baker,
with the English copy, also having authority to exchange ratification,
ploughed the seas, an event was in the making of destiny, which, when
brought forth, utterly confounded the carefully laid plans of the Liverpool-Castlereagh
Government, and in fact ushered in a new epoch, a new and
greater era for the young American Republic&mdash;never again to be pointed
to as an experiment.</p>

<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX.</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Washington, the First of 1815.</span></h2>
<p>One of the most thrilling incidents in our history is the reception by
the country of the news of the Battle of New Orleans. It was theatrically
acclaimed, with almost delirious joy, sharply contrasting with the condition
of deep discouragement and gloom it suddenly dissipated. Seldom
has a victory had more dramatic setting. It is well for us who enjoy
the rich blessings of the present, occasionally to read of the trials and
tribulations through which our forebears struggled, that they might hand
these blessings down to us. &ldquo;If an old man of perfect memory,&rdquo; says
James Parton, in Chapter 20 of the second volume of the Life of Andrew
Jackson, published in 1860, &ldquo;were asked to name the time when the prospects
of this republic were shrouded in deepest gloom, and the largest
number of the people despaired of its future, his answer, I think, would
be, &lsquo;the first thirty-seven days of the year 1815.&rsquo;&rdquo; (Parton makes an
error of two days, for the news of the battle of New Orleans reached
Washington February 4th.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Capital,&rdquo; says Parton, &ldquo;was in ruins&rdquo; (as a result of its burning
by the British the preceding August).</p>
<p>Parton further referred to the Hartford Convention, which on January
5th had closed several weeks of session. This anti-war convention
was denounced as treasonable by administrative papers. It had aroused
gravest apprehensions of disunion unless peace should at once be made.</p>
<p>In order to convey an idea of the antagonistic spirit prevailing, quotation
is here given from the <i>Boston Gazette</i>, of that period: &ldquo;Is there a
Federalist, a patriot in America, who conceives it his duty to shed his
blood for Bonaparte, for Madison and Jefferson, and that host of ruffians
in Congress, who have set their faces against us for years, and spirited
up the brutal part of the populace to destroy us? Not one! Shall we,
then, any longer be held in slavery, and driven to desperate poverty by
such a graceless faction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parton further quotes many New England editors as saying: &ldquo;No
more taxes from New England, till the administration makes peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parton further says that the great British expedition, so long mustering
in the West Indies, so long delayed, cast a prodigious shadow before
it, putting New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore on their guard; but
that as the autumn passed without the reappearance of hostile force in
the northern waters, the conviction gained ground that something overwhelming
was in contemplation against the defenseless south and southwest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It so chanced,&rdquo; continues Parton, &ldquo;that the 8th of January was the
days on which it was first whispered about Washington that the President
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
had received news of the British fleet at the mouth of the Mississippi.
From that time the eyes of the country were fixed upon New Orleans&mdash;not
hopefully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not an overstatement of the case,&rdquo; continues Parton, &ldquo;to say
that there was not one well informed man in the northern states who
believed that New Orleans could be successfully defended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again quoting from Parton: &ldquo;After a week of gossip and foreboding,
came news of the gunboat battle, and its disastrous results; also rumors
of a great armament hovering on the Atlantic coast. &lsquo;We are a lost
country,&rsquo; said the Federal papers in doleful concert. &lsquo;A wicked administration
has ruined us. New Orleans having fallen an easy prey, the
British General will leave a few acclimated black regiments to garrison
that city, and bring the Wellington heroes around to the Chesapeake.
Baltimore will not be able to resist. Washington will again be overrun,
Philadelphia and New York will next be attacked, and who shall say
with what results? See to what a pass Jefferson and French democracy
have brought a deluded country!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>All sorts of dire rumors were in circulation, and to add to the gloom
that prevailed in Washington and elsewhere, a snow storm of remarkable
violence and extent set in on the 23rd of January, and continued for
three days. Belated mails straggled in, showing that the American Army
was still resisting. &ldquo;New Orleans is not taken yet,&rdquo; said the Western
members, and the Republican editors. &ldquo;It is merely a question of time,&rdquo;
replied the Federalists; &ldquo;the next mail will finish New Orleans and you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the midst of that setting, on February 4th, a horseman came into
Washington, bearing glorious news for the Administration forces. He
had dispatches from General Jackson, detailing the decisive victory of
January 8th.</p>
<p>Washington was wild with delight at the unexpected victory. &ldquo;That
evening,&rdquo; still quoting from Parton, &ldquo;the town was blazing with light,
and the whole populace was abroad, now thronging about the White
House (temporary), cheering the President, then surging around the
houses of the Secretaries, and residences of the leading supporters of the
war, rending the air with shouts.... The next issue of the <i>National
Intelligencer</i> cannot be glanced over to this day without exciting in the
mind something of the feeling which is wont to express itself by three
times three and one cheer more. The great news was headed, in the <i>Intelligencer&rsquo;s</i>
largest type, &lsquo;Almost Incredible Victory!!!!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was worth a life time to experience the jubilation of that night!
It was the sudden restoration of a people&rsquo;s national self-respect.</p>
<p>The news of the reception of the victory elsewhere was equally as
thrilling. It aroused what Parton called the &ldquo;maddest enthusiasm.&rdquo; A
quotation may be given from the autobiography of Mr. John Binns:
&ldquo;A general illumination was ordered in Philadelphia. Few indeed there
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
were yet there were a few who on that night closed their window shutters
and mourned the defeat of the enemies of their country. I had early
intelligence of this joyful news, and gladly, by an extra, spread it abroad.
I put scene painters to work, and had a transparency painted, which covered
nearly the whole front of my house. There had been a heavy snow
fall, and there was that evening from nine to twelve inches of snow on
the ground. That, however, did not prevent men, women and children
from parading the street, and delighting their eyes by looking at the
illumination and illuminated transparencies, which made the principal
streets of our city as light as day. My transparency represented General
Jackson on horseback at the head of his staff, in pursuit of the enemy,
with the motto: &lsquo;This day shall ne&rsquo;er go by, from this day to the ending
of the world, but He, in it, shall be remembered.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This gives in brief a glimpse of the effect in the country of the news
of the victory at New Orleans. How can any American describe it as a
needless battle? After the event it might have been deplored by the
British as needless, just as any lost battle may be so regarded.</p>
<p>Just ten days after that lone horseman rode into Washington on
February 4th, the Treaty reached the Capitol, and under the inspiration
of the great victory at New Orleans, it was joyfully and speedily ratified.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER X.</span>
<br /><span class="sc">But What If the Issue of the Battle Had Been Different?</span></h2>
<p>As stated in the <a href="#c12">last chapter</a>, the Peace Treaty was speedily and joyfully
ratified. But what if the issue of the battle had been different?</p>
<p>The chronology of the Treaty may here be given:</p>
<p>Signed at Ghent, on the 24th day of December, 1814, by the Peace
Commissioners representing the two countries;</p>
<p>Ratified for England by the Prince Regent on December 31st, 1814.</p>
<p>Reached Washington the night of February 14th, 1815;</p>
<p>Sent by President Madison to the Senate February 15th;</p>
<p>Ratification advised by the Senate, February 16th;</p>
<p>Ratified by President Madison February 17th, and ratification exchanged
with England&rsquo;s representative the same day;</p>
<p>Promulgated by President Madison February 18th; thus ending the
period of hostilities.</p>
<p>Would the United States Senate have advised ratification, or would
the President have ratified, if the British on January 8th, had swept aside
that defensive army and had carried into effect the design to capture and
occupy Louisiana?</p>
<p>Probably no more grave or serious situation has ever confronted an
American President than that which would have been presented. By
ratifying the treaty, the President would have satisfied the New England
malcontents, who had given veiled threats of disunion. But by the
ratification with England in possession of Louisiana, and holding that
it was not a legal possession of the United States, the President would
have faced a desperate alternative of giving up Louisiana, and the trans-Mississippi
territory; or referring it to the issue of a future war, or future
negotiations.</p>
<p>It is the belief of the writer that President Madison would have declined
to ratify the Treaty, as long as the British remained in occupation
of Louisiana; thus prolonging the war with its uncertainties, and taking
the risk of the disruption of the Union, through a separate peace with
England by the New England States; a proposition which, as we have
seen, was in contemplation by the English Government.</p>
<p>All of these questions, so momentous, to the American Union, were
happily and gloriously averted by the marvelous defensive victory at
New Orleans.</p>
<p>And yet, American historians teach our children that that battle was
a needless one!</p>
<p>Oh, ignorance! Oh, prejudice! Oh, pro-English!!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI.</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Testimony From General Jackson Himself.</span></h2>
<p>In presenting this case against the school historians, which he feels
has already been made, to the satisfaction of any impartial reader, the
writer has refrained from using much confirmatory material in order
to be as brief as possible. But in the history of Andrew Jackson, written
by A. C. Buell, and published in 1904, there occurs illuminating data
highly apropos in this connection. It may be remarked that Buell is not
a favorite of some historians. Buell was distinctly not pro-English.</p>
<p>In chapter 3 of the second volume of Buell&rsquo;s history, entitled &ldquo;British
Designs on Louisiana,&rdquo; the author reiterates a statement before made,
that Jackson&rsquo;s Army of New Orleans saved the Louisiana Purchase, and
adds that few people of the millions who were celebrating in 1904 the
centenary of the colossal transaction between Napoleon Bonaparte and
Thomas Jefferson, realized the significance of these words. Buell later
says: &ldquo;Viewed in the light of its actual influence on the map of North
America, and the fortunes of this Republic, it was the most important
battle ever fought between Great Britain and the United States.... The
real, vast, enduring value of the Battle of New Orleans, lay in the fact
that it prevented another war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In adducing evidence of the purpose of the English Government
against Louisiana, Buell says: &ldquo;The fleet carried more than an army, the
narratives of the subaltern and Capt. Cooke, reputable British officers of
85th and 43rd Light Infantry, respectively, tell us there was on board
the fleet &lsquo;a complete civil government staff&rsquo; to be installed in place of
the State Government of Louisiana at the moment of occupation. One
of them, with a spice of humor, informs us that one member of this &lsquo;civil
government staff&rsquo; was &lsquo;a worthy Colonial official whose confidence in the
success of the Expedition led him to resign the comfortable position of
Collector of Barbadoes to take the larger and more lucrative post for the
(to-be) Crown Colony of Louisiana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As other members of the civil government staff Mr. Buell names
Honorable Mr. Elwood, Lieut. Governor, transferred from Trinidad, and
Mr. Dockstader, transferred from upper Canada; also an Attorney-General,
an Admiralty Judge, and a Secretary of the Colony, sent from
England direct.</p>
<p>Mr. Buell continues: &ldquo;Besides his general orders at Plymouth, Pakenham
brought with him a proclamation approved by the Home Government
or Colonial office. This proclamation was to be published as soon as the
British Army should occupy New Orleans. It promised protection to
everybody, general amnesty to all previously engaged in hostilities, and
proclaimed the sovereignty of England, in behalf of Spain, over all the
territory fraudulently conveyed by Bonaparte to the United States. It
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
denied the validity of the secret treaty by which Spain re-ceded Louisiana
to France in 1800. It denied Bonaparte&rsquo;s right to act for France in 1803.
And finally it &lsquo;denounced the pretentions of the United States to sovereignty
under the alleged purchase from Bonaparte.&rsquo; This proclamation
was in printed form at British headquarters the night before the battle,
and its contents were well known to many British officers. The night
after the battle it disappeared. Every copy of it was burned!</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this evidence was obtained from British prisoners taken in the
battle of January 8th. But it lacked one link to make the chain perfect.
That was evidence of specific design and fixed policy on the part of the
British Government. In the absence of such evidence the cabinet of
St. James might, in emergency, declare that the scheme of a &lsquo;crown
colony&rsquo; and the proclamation itself were the acts of General Pakenham&mdash;to
be approved if he succeeded or disavowed if he failed. The needed
link was supplied long after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The final link in the chain,&rdquo; says Mr. Buell, &ldquo;was furnished by
General Jackson himself. In the fall of 1875, the author, then a staff
correspondent of the <i>Missouri Republican</i>, visited former Governor William
Allen, of Ohio, at his farm near Chillicothe. During the visit,
which was of three days&rsquo; duration, the venerable statesman&rsquo;s conversation&mdash;when
not upon agricultural subjects&mdash;was mainly of reminiscences
of his earlier public life. All was interesting; some of it historically
valuable, particularly those parts relating to the British invasion of Louisiana.
What Governor Allen said on this subject we reproduce here,
exactly as it was printed in 1875.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Governor Allen&rsquo;s interview is here given in full:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Near the end of General Jackson&rsquo;s second administration and shortly
after the admission of Arkansas to the Union, I, being Senator elect from
Ohio, went to Washington to take the seat on March 4th.</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Jackson,&mdash;he always preferred to be called General rather
than Mr. President, and so we always addressed him by his military
title&mdash;General Jackson invited me to lunch with him. No sooner were
we seated than he said: &lsquo;Mr. Allen, let us take a little drink to the new
star in the flag&mdash;Arkansas.&rsquo; This ceremony being duly observed, the
General said: &lsquo;Allen, if there had been disaster instead of victory at New
Orleans, there never would have been a state of Arkansas.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, of course, interested me, and I asked: &lsquo;Why do you say that,
General?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he said, that if Pakenham had taken New Orleans, the British
would have claimed and held the whole Louisiana Purchase. But I said:
&lsquo;You know, General Jackson, that the treaty of Ghent, which had been
signed fifteen days before the battle, provided for restoration of all territory,
places and possessions taken by either nation from the other during
the war, with certain unimportant exceptions.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, of course,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;But the minutes of the conference at
Ghent as kept by Mr. Gallatin, represent the British commissioners as
declaring in exact words: &lsquo;We do not admit Bonaparte&rsquo;s construction of
the law of nations; and we cannot accept it in relation to any subject
matter before us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At that moment,&rsquo; pursued General Jackson, &lsquo;none of our Commissioners
knew what the real meaning of these words was. When they
were uttered, the British Commissioners knew that Pakenham&rsquo;s expedition
had been decided on. Our Commissioners did not know it. Now,
since I have been Chief Magistrate, I have learned from diplomatic
sources of the most unquestionable authority, that the British ministry
did not intend the Treaty of Ghent to apply to the Louisiana Purchase
at all. The whole corporation of them, from 1803 to 1815&mdash;Pitt, the
Duke of Portland, Granville, Percival, Lord Liverpool and Castlereagh&mdash;denied
the legal right of Napoleon to sell Louisiana to us, and they held,
therefore, that we had no right to that territory. So you see, Allen, that
the words of Mr. Goulburn, on behalf of the British Commissioners, which
I have quoted to you from Albert Gallatin&rsquo;s Minutes of the Conference,
had a far deeper significance than our commissioners could perpetrate.
Those words were meant to lay the foundation for a claim on the Louisiana
Purchase entirely external to the provisions of the Treaty of Ghent. And
in that way the British Government was signing a treaty with one hand
in front while with the other hand behind its back it was despatching
Pakenham&rsquo;s army to seize the fairest of our possessions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You can also see, my dear William,&rsquo; said the old General, waxing
warm (having once or twice more during the luncheon toasted the new
star), &lsquo;you can also see what an awful mess such a situation would have
been if the British programme had been carried out in full. But Providence
willed otherwise. All the tangled web that the cunning of the
English Diplomats could weave around our unsuspecting commissioners
at Ghent was torn to pieces and soaked with British blood in half an
hour at New Orleans by the never-missing rifles of my Tennessee and
Kentucky pioneers. And that ended it. British diplomacy could do
wonders, but it couldn&rsquo;t provide against such a contingency as that. The
British Commissioners could throw sand in the eyes of ours at Ghent,
but they couldn&rsquo;t help the cold lead that my riflemen sprinkled in the
faces of their soldiers at New Orleans. Now, Allen, you have the whole
story. Now you know why Arkansas was saved at New Orleans. Let&rsquo;s
take another little one.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas E. Watson, at one time United States Senator from Georgia,
in a history of Jackson, written after Buell&rsquo;s history, quotes this interview
and comments that it settles the question, and that if the British
had captured New Orleans, the United States boundary line would have
stopped at the Mississippi.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII.</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Captain Garland&rsquo;s Testimony On the Spot.</span></h2>
<p>Captain Henry Garland was one of Jackson&rsquo;s young officers at New
Orleans. In view of the brilliance and stirring eloquence of a speech
made by him, which I am about to give, from the same chapter heretofore
quoted from Buell, it will be interesting to give a digest of Buell&rsquo;s
description of him: He was born at Nantes, France, his father a merchant
of Norfolk, Virginia, residing there as Commercial Agent for American
importing houses. He received his education in French schools. Coming
to America, he went to Tennessee, and in the War of 1812 volunteered in
Coffee&rsquo;s mounted riflemen, serving with distinction throughout the war.</p>
<p>In the latter part of March, 1815, the officers of the Louisiana militia
gave a banquet to those of the Tennessee, Kentucky and Mississippi troops
and the Regulars, on the eve of the disbandment of Jackson&rsquo;s Army. Captain
Garland was selected by his comrades to respond in French on their
behalf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The guests,&rdquo; said Buell, &ldquo;were welcomed on behalf of the Creole
hosts and hostesses by Vicar-General, the Most Reverend Abbe Dubourg,
Bishop of Louisiana, who made a brief address of welcome, first in English
and then in French. In conclusion, the Abbe expressed sorrow that
such an awful battle should have been fought and so many souls sent unprepared
into the presence of the Creator, two weeks after the Treaty
of Peace had been signed on the other side of the Ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Buell, the Abbe&rsquo;s remarks changed the whole character
of Garland&rsquo;s reply. He spoke in French, which was afterwards translated.</p>
<p>The writer recommends a full reading of this, at points, remarkably
eloquent speech, from which some excerpts are here given.</p>
<p>After some introductory remarks, Captain Garland said: &ldquo;The most
reverend prelate, in his otherwise well chosen remarks, suggested that
it was a pity that such an awful battle should have been fought after the
Treaty was signed across the wide water. I do not agree with him. It
needed that battle to make the Treaty good. It made no difference when
the Treaty was signed. Without that battle it must have been waste paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Treaty as written, did not mean anything. It says that the
territorial status quo ante bellum shall be observed. But the British Cabinet
held &lsquo;&rsquo;l&rsquo;arriere pensee&rsquo; about that. They never admitted Napoleon&rsquo;s
right to convey Louisiana to us through President Jefferson. They did
not mean to include the Louisiana Purchase in the territorial status quo
ante bellum!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Treaty signed in ink on the 24th of December was a cheat. But
the Treaty that the Pioneers of Tennessee and Kentucky punctuated with
rifle bullets the 8th of January will stand. The English diplomats
at Ghent held, as I have said, &lsquo;&rsquo;l&rsquo;arriere-pensee.&rsquo; But the British soldiers
who lay down to die in front of Kentucky and Tennessee the 8th of January
on Chalmette plain were sincere and honest. It was in their life
blood that the real treaty was written; not in the ink of Ghent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The English plan of subjugation was complete. Soon after the battle
it was learned that General Pakenham had a proclamation written, signed
and ready to be promulgated the moment his Army should enter the
City. This proclamation denied the right of Napoleon to sell Louisiana,
denounced the pretentions of the United States to its sovereignty, declared
that Spain, the rightful possessor, was incapable of maintaining
her territorial rights, and, finally, asserted a provisional occupation by
the British forces as a virtual protectorate in behalf of the Spanish Crown.
The night after the battle, this proclamation was burned. It may have
been used to illuminate the scene where the corpse of its author was being
prepared for shipment to England in a cask of rum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is commonly known that, the night of January 7th, a council of
war was held in the British camp. It is also known to many that, on
that occasion, Major-General Sir Samuel Gibbs spoke of General Jackson&rsquo;s
Army as a &lsquo;backwoods rabble.&rsquo; He was right. That&rsquo;s what we are&mdash;from
the point of view of a British regular. We are &lsquo;Backwoodsmen,&rsquo;
because we were born and raised in little log cabins all along our great
frontier. The mothers who gave us milk, made their own clothes, and
ours, too, of homespun or of buckskin. As soon as we could lift a rifle
we had to hunt our meat in the woods. Yes, we are &lsquo;backwoodsmen.&rsquo;
And from the point of view of a British regular, we are a &lsquo;rabble,&rsquo; too.
That is, we are not soldiers in the regular sense of the term. We are
not enlisted; we don&rsquo;t get any pay. We are simply assembled, as volunteers,
to defend our country. We have a kind of organization, it is true;
but it is as independent companies, composed of neighbors, and our officers
are simply those men whose characters and experience point them out as
natural leaders. In one word, we have no regulations, except those of
common sense; no discipline, except that of common consent; no mastery,
one over the other, except that of manhood! Such are the men who rallied
from Tennessee and Kentucky when Andrew Jackson called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ladies and Gentlemen, they are a &lsquo;backwoods rabble.&rsquo; They
met, say, three times their number of soldiers who were the Pride of
England! And the &lsquo;Backwoods Rabble&rsquo; laid that &lsquo;Pride of England&rsquo;
low!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;And now just one word more: Most people say that our American
Republic was born the fourth day of July, 1776, at Philadelphia. This
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
is not true. It was only begotten then. It was born when Burgoyne
surrendered at Saratoga. It was baptised when Cornwallis yielded at
Yorktown. But it was never confirmed, as they say in the religion of the
Holy Saviour, until the 8th of last January!</p>
<p>&ldquo;That day saw not merely the repulse and destruction of a British
Army, but it taught the whole world a lesson never to be forgot. It needs
not the gift of prophecy to foresee that the battle fought by Andrew Jackson
and his &lsquo;backwoods rabble&rsquo; did more than repulse cowardly and treacherous
invasion. It taught to all the princes and kings and emperors on
the face of the earth that they must let our young Republic alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apart from his testimony as to Pakenham&rsquo;s intended proclamation,
and apart from his estimate of British diplomacy, the speech of Captain
Garland is well worth preserving as a specimen of real, patriotic eloquence.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>From the mass of evidence, available to any earnest historian, the
writer has selected one more witness, whose testimony is compressed, in
an incidental paragraph. At the meeting of the American Historical Association
in New Orleans in 1903, Dr. W. M. Sloane read a paper entitled,
&ldquo;The World Aspects of the Louisiana Purchase.&rdquo; It is published
in Volume I of the &ldquo;Proceedings of the American Historical Association
of 1903.&rdquo; In that paper (page 102 of Proceedings above cited) appears
this sentence: &ldquo;But for Jefferson&rsquo;s wisdom in explorating it (Louisiana)
might have remained a wilderness long after settlement began; Great
Britain coveted it in 1815 when Jackson saved it.&rdquo; There is a sentence
compact with fact. Dr. William M. Sloane (now dead) was at the time
of the address, and for many years professor of history at Princeton University,
and a recognized authority on history.</p>
<p>In all literature there cannot be found a more concrete, comprehensive
line: &ldquo;Great Britain coveted it in 1815 when Jackson saved it.&rdquo;
Pro-English historians may deftly turn and twist this and other facts to
their purpose; but let me give a tocsin call: PRO-ENGLISH HISTORIANS
SHOULD BE KEPT OUT OF OUR SCHOOLS, AND
YOUNG AMERICA TAUGHT ONLY THE UNGARBLED, UNVARNISHED
TRUTH.</p>

<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII.</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Recapitulation.</span></h2>
<p>The writer, in these pages, has shown by what must be conceded on
all sides, irrefragable evidence that school histories are in error in saying
the Battle of New Orleans was fought after peace, and was therefore a
needless battle.</p>
<p>The writer has also shown by evidence he considers conclusive, that
England held as invalid the title of the United States to Louisiana, acquired
by sale from Bonaparte to the United States in 1803; that England
deliberately planned the conquest of Louisiana (with the resultant
development, if successful, of a great dominion to the west of the United
States, like Canada on the North). That evidence is mainly furnished
by the British themselves. First in the British note to the United States
Peace Commissioners, criticizing the title of the United States to Louisiana;
and, second, in the fitting out and dispatching of the expedition
against New Orleans during the peace negotiations; in the complete Civil
Government staff, for Louisiana, carried by the expedition; in the record
of the peace negotiations, first in the insistence by the British upon the
Uti Possidetis principle, and, second, when that failed, in the proposal of
words to be inserted in the Mutual Restoration clause, which proposal
finally resulted in the word, &ldquo;Possessions&rdquo; in that clause, under which
England could hold that Louisiana, having been taken, was not subject
to return, not being a possession of the United States; further in the
letter of Prime Minister Liverpool to Lord Castlereagh, assuming British
occupation of New Orleans, outlining purpose to &ldquo;frighten Madison&rdquo; into
signing the Treaty (thus leaving England in possession of Louisiana).</p>
<p>After close and careful study, the writer presents as a summary of
his conclusion as to the value of the Battle of New Orleans:</p>
<p>First, that it was a highly necessary battle on the part of the United
States, rendered so by British aggression;</p>
<p>Second, that the statement in school and other histories that it was
fought after peace is entirely false, the Peace Treaty itself being evidence.
(All historians, past, present, and to come, cannot change the text
of that Treaty);</p>
<p>Third, that it saved the Louisiana Purchase to the United States or
averted another war with England;</p>
<p>Fourth, that it settled forever the question of the title to Louisiana;</p>
<p>Fifth, that it created a profound impression on the world. Speaking,
as one orator has put it, in language all nations could understand, that
the young American Republic had the will to be free and the power to
enforce that will;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Sixth, that it marked the last time that the foot of a foreign foe has
been set on American soil, except when Mexico invaded Texas in 1846;</p>
<p>Seventh, that it practically added to the Peace Treaty that impressment
and orders in council would no longer be imposed by England, for
these obnoxious policies were never sought to be revived;</p>
<p>Eighth, that it saved this sorely harassed, nearly treason-torn country,
at a critical time in its life, from threatened and possible disunion, and
re-established national self-respect;</p>
<p>Ninth, that it made Andrew Jackson a national hero, resulting in his
election as President of the United States, and the establishment of what
is known as the Jackson era;</p>
<p>Tenth, that it resulted in mutual respect and friendship between the
United States and England, which has endured to this day, and which
it is hoped will perpetually endure.</p>
<p>Could any battle have had a greater or more varied effect?</p>
<p>School historians and other historians, in appraising the battle as a
needless and useless one, do violence to truth and grossly impose upon
Young America, as well as America in general.</p>
<p>The underlying American sentiment of honor, truth and justice demands
revision of these school histories, and that right speedily.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the writer recommends, as revision, in those histories
which desire to dispose of the Battle of New Orleans in a paragraph, the
following:</p>
<p>The Battle of New Orleans, fought January 8, 1815, was one of the
most brilliant defensive victories in history. Many historians have classed
it as a needless victory in that it was fought after peace. That is an
error, for the Peace Treaty, signed by the Commissioners of the two
countries, December 24, 1814, specifically provided that it should not be
effective until ratified by both sides. It was not ratified by the United
States until February 17, 1815, soon after its reception. The news of the
victory came at a critical time in the history of the country, and was
received with great enthusiasm everywhere. It settled forever all question
as to the title of the United States to Louisiana. It saved Louisiana,
or a least averted another war with England. It resulted in lasting, solid
peace with England, which should permanently endure. As illustration
of the character of that peace, it may be pointed out that the boundary
line between the United States and Canada extending about three thousand
miles, has not, on either side, a fort or fortification. God help the
English-speaking people if one should ever be necessary!</p>

<h3>WORDING OF THE TREATY OF GHENT.</h3>
<p>In addition to the references cited on pages <a href="#Page_18">18</a> and <a href="#Page_30">30</a> as to the full
text of the Treaty of Ghent reference may be given to volume compiled
by Hunter Miller entitled: &ldquo;Treaties and Other International Acts of the
United States of America.&rdquo; (See volume 2, pages 574-584.)</p>
<h3>ENGLISH CRITICISM OF U. S. TITLE TO LOUISIANA.</h3>
<p>The third and fourth paragraphs of the note of the British Commissioners
to the American Commissioners at Ghent October 8, 1814, read as
follows:</p>
<p>In adverting for this purpose to the acquisition of Louisiana, the undersigned
must observe that the instrument by which the consent of His
Catholic Majesty is alleged to have been given to the cession of it has
never been made public. His Catholic Majesty was no party to the treaty
by which the cession was made, and if any sanction has been subsequently
obtained from him, it must have been, like other contemporaneous acts of
that monarch, involuntary, and, as such, cannot alter the character of the
transaction. The Marquis of Yrujo, the minister of His Catholic Majesty
at Washington, in a letter addressed to the President of the United States,
formally protested against the cession, and the right of France to make it;
yet in the face of this protestation, so strongly evincing the decided opinion
of Spain as to the illegality of the proceeding, the President of the
United States ratified the treaty. Can it be contended that the annexation
of Louisiana, under such circumstances, did not mark a spirit of territorial
aggrandizement?</p>
<p>His Britannic Majesty did certainly express satisfaction when the
American Government communicated the event that Louisiana, a valuable
colony in the possession of France, with whom the war had just been renewed,
instead of remaining in the hands of his enemy, had been ceded to
the United States, at that time professing the most friendly disposition
towards Great Britain, and an intention of providing for her interest in the
acquisition. But the conditions under which France had acquired Louisiana
from Spain were not communicated; the refusal of Spain to consent
to its alienation was not known; the protest of her ambassador had not
been made; and many other circumstances attending the transaction, on
which it is now unnecessary to dilate, were, as there is good to believe,
industriously concealed. (From American State Papers, Foreign Relations,
Volume III, page 721.)</p>
<p>The reply of the American Commissioners is quoted on <a href="#Page_26">page 26</a> of this
volume.</p>
<p>(Author&rsquo;s note: From the foregoing we can better understand the refusal
of the British Commissioners to discuss the northern boundary of
Louisiana as proposed in American note of November 10. See <a href="#Page_26">page 26</a>,
this volume.)</p>
<h3>THE UTI POSSIDETIS PROPOSAL.</h3>
<p>The note of the British Commissioners, October 21, 1814, contained the
following paragraph:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>In regard to other boundaries, the American plenipotentiaries, in their
note of August 24, appeared in some measure to object to the propositions
then made by the undersigned, as not being on the basis of uti possidetis.
The undersigned are willing to treat on that basis, subject to such modifications
as mutual convenience may be found to require; and they trust that
the American plenipotentiaries will show, by their ready acceptance of this
basis, that they duly appreciate the moderation of His Majesty&rsquo;s Government
in so far consulting the honor and fair pretensions of the United
States as, in the relative situation of the two countries, to authorize such a
proposition. (From American State Papers, Foreign Relations, Volume
III.)</p>
<p>(Author&rsquo;s note: This is an adroit effort to put upon the Americans the
initial suggestion of the Uti Possidetis. The Americans, after seeing the
futility of any treaty agreement as to impressment and trade restriction,
adhered steadily to the Status Quo Ante Bellum basis. They rejected the
Uti Possidetis principle. It should be borne in mind that at the time of
the above note the secret expedition against Louisiana, assembling in
Nigril Bay, Jamaica, was nearing completion.)</p>
<h3>TIME OF EFFECTIVENESS OF TREATY.</h3>
<p>On November 10, 1814, the American Commissioners submitted a
<span class="u"><i>projet</i></span> of a treaty containing in article one the statement that &ldquo;All hostilities,
both by sea and land, shall immediately cease,&rdquo; and in article fifteen
the statement that &ldquo;This treaty, when the same shall have been ratified on
both sides, and the respective ratifications mutually exchanged, shall be
binding upon both parties, and the ratifications shall be exchanged at
______ in the space of ______ months from
this day, or sooner if possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On November 26 the British Commissioners returned the <span class="u"><i>projet</i></span>, altered
to read that &ldquo;All hostilities, both by sea and land, shall cease after the
exchange of ratifications as hereafter mentioned,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;This treaty,
when the same shall have ratified on both sides, and the ratifications mutually
exchanged, shall be binding on both parties, and the ratifications shall
be exchanged at Washington with all practical despatch, in the space of
______ months from this day, or sooner if practicable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On November 30, 1814, the American Commissioners stated in a note
to the British Commissioners:</p>
<p>The undersigned consent that the day of the exchange of the ratifications
be substituted to that of the signature of the treaty as the time for the
cessation of hostilities, and for regulating the periods after which prizes
at sea shall be restored; it being understood that measures shall be adopted
for a speedy exchange of ratifications. (American State Papers, Foreign
Relations, Volume III.)</p>
<p>(Author&rsquo;s note: It will thus be seen that the British proposed the date
of ratification as the time of the effectiveness of the treaty, and the cessation
of hostilities, and that the Americans consented, thus carrying into
the treaty the provision so uniformly overlooked by our historians.)</p>
<h3>PASSAMAQUODDY ISLANDS.</h3>
<p>(Author&rsquo;s note: There was towards the end of the negotiations at Ghent
much and voluminous correspondence, mainly on the part of the British,
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
concerning the question involved in the Passamaquoddy Islands situation;
it was magnified, admittedly, out of proportion to the subject involved,
especially in view of the fact that the final disposition of these fisheries
was relegated to a civil commission to meet after peace. The British,
while conceding the relative insignificance of the islands, maintained that
a question of honor was involved which might &ldquo;prove an insuperable bar
to the conclusion of peace at the present time.&rdquo; In reading the mass of
British correspondence on the subject of these islands one is forced to the
conclusion that there was an underlying purpose.)</p>
<h3>AS TO WORDING IN MUTUAL RESTORATION CLAUSE.</h3>
<p>The American <span class="u"><i>projet</i></span> of November 10 contained also the proposition
that all territory, places, and possessions &ldquo;taken by either party from the
other during the war, or which may be taken after the signing of this
treaty, shall be restored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <span class="u"><i>projet</i></span> returned on November 26 by the British Commissioners
was altered to read all territory, places, and possessions, &ldquo;belonging to
either party and taken by the other during the war, or which may be taken
after the signing of this treaty, shall be restored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The protocol of a conference of the American and British Commissioners,
held on December 1, contained the following statements:</p>
<p>At a conference held this day, the American plenipotentiaries proposed
the following alterations in their <span class="u"><i>projet</i></span>, as amended by the British plenipotentiaries:
1st&mdash;In article I, strike out the alteration consisting of the
words &ldquo;belonging to,&rdquo; and &ldquo;taken by,&rdquo; and preserve the original reading,
viz: &ldquo;taken by either party from the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This alteration was objected to by the British plenipotentiaries, and,
after some discussion, reserved by them for the consideration of their Government.
(Ibid., pages 735, 742.)</p>
<p>(Author&rsquo;s note: The American Commissioners stated in a note December
14, to the British Commissioners that they agreed to accept the British
proposal to &ldquo;omit the words originally offered by them,&rdquo; provided that the
Passamaquoddy Islands should alone be excepted from the mutual restoration
of territory. See American State Papers, Volume III, pages 743,
744, for full text of note. Also for text of letter from British Commissioners
to British Government as of December 13, see Photostat in Library of
Congress from Public Record Office, London&mdash;Foreign Office 5, Vol. 102.
Thus in the mutual restoration clause of the treaty the words &ldquo;all places,
points, and &lsquo;possessions&rsquo; whatsoever,&rdquo; went in, without the clarifying term
as to &ldquo;possessions&rdquo; proposed by the British. Did the British Government
deem the clarification essential? Evidence, too strong for disbelief, shows it
did not. The secret expedition against Louisiana was then well on its way,
and expected to be in possession of New Orleans any day, with the full
set of civil officers, carried on Admiral Cochran&rsquo;s fleet, installed and in
control. Evidence has been given showing the anxiety of British officials,
after the signing of the treaty, as to its ratification by President Madison.
If the British plans against Louisiana had succeeded would President
Madison have ratified the treaty? That is a fair question for College debate.)</p>

computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
